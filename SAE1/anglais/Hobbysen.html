                Badminton is a racket sport that opposes two players (this is called single) or two teams of two players (that's double). I am going to introduce you to badminton in the school context, that is to say the specifics
                of an inter-school competition, formally known as UNSS. In our case during a meeting between two teams 5 matches take place: one men's single, one women's single, one men's double, one women's double,
                and finally one mixed double (the double is made up of a man and a woman). There is a particularity in competitions of this type, it is that the matches are in 20 points and that they follow each other. 
                That means that the second game starts with the score of the previous one. For example a match can start at 9 - 20, and it will stop as soon as one of the two teams gets 40 points. The winner is therefore the first team to reach 100 points.

            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <article id="p2">

                Why did I decide to talk about this sport? Badminton is a sport that I love to play, indeed during my four years of middle school, I played this sport with my friends during the midday break. We were not there to practise seriously but for fun. In 11th grade I started my first year in a club, again with a friend for fun without competition. When suddenly by chance, my school
                decided to form a badminton team to compete in UNSS. There were already two girls who already had a lot of experience and talent. However, boys were needed for the team to be complete. I was finally taken on the team along with two 10th graders to whom we explained
                the rules on the bus ride to the first meeting.

            <h2>The Tournament</h2>
            <article id="p3">
                In the first game our team was in difficulty because most of us were beginners. However, the girls saved the team with good advice and by catching up the missing points. Finally we ended up winning this first game and were qualified for the semi-final and final if we won.
                A few weeks later at the second meeting we realized that the level was much higher than at the previous meeting. But we were determined to give it our best anyway. We had nothing to lose because the team didn't even have to exist. So again thanks to good advice and determination we made it to the final against a team that seemed to have a big gap in level compared to the other teams we faced. Unfortunately we lost 
                80 - 100, so we came in as academic vice-champions with this team that on paper was not the favorite. It was a great adventure!
                P.S.: we learned shortly afterwards that the team we lost to became the French UNSS champions.
