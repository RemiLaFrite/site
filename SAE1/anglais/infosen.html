                I studied during my four years of middle school at the "Collège du Nonennbruch" in Lutterbach.
                I followed a German billingual curriculum. I have always preferred science to literature.
                At the time I was not as attracted by computer science but math was my favorite discipline.
                Like a lot of young people I played to many video games and I wasn't too interested in how it worked.

                I continued my high school studies at "Lycée Jean-Henri Lambert" in Mulhouse.
                Although I am not passionate about literature, I decided to continue my billingual curriculum
                with the Abibac department. Like in middle school I was more interested in 
                scientific disciplines, so I decided to choose the "scientific" majors: mathematics, physics and biology.
                Then for my last year and for the baccalauréat I kept biology and math, and I took on three more hours of 
                optional "expert" math.

                After long consideration I decided to apply for your program for many reasons.
                First of all, I wanted to continue my billingual curriculum. I'm passionate about
                discovering new cultures and travelling. Secondly during my teenage years I started asking myself about how 
                the things around me work and more specifically the new technologies. 
                Finally, my third motive was my father, he works in this domain and did the same studies as me but a few 
                years back.
